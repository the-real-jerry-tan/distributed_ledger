# Distributed Ledger using Blockchain Technology

## Project Description

This project implements a distributed ledger system using blockchain technology for immutability. It fulfills the requirements for a double-entry accounting system and can support assets such as cryptocurrencies, fiat currency, and other similarly valued items.

## Features

- Blockchain structure with cryptographic hashing
- Double-entry accounting transactions
- Proof of Work (simple nonce-based mining)
- Immutability of data once transactions are added
- Validation of the blockchain and transactions
- Support for mining rewards

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/the-real-jerry-tan/distributed_ledger.git
   cd distributed-ledger-typescript
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Compile the TypeScript files:
   ```bash
   tsc
   ```

4. Run the project:
